The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong\nsales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if\nthe revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nlower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also\nbenefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our\ngross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix\nwithin GeForce GPUs.\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a\nshift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions.\n36\n\n**Table p36_1**\n\n| Graphics | $ | 15,868 |  | $ | 9,834 |  | $ | 6,034 |  | 61 | % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Compute & Networking | 11,046 |  |  | 6,841 |  |  | 4,205 |  |  | 61 | % |\n| Total | $ | 26,914 |  | $ | 16,675 |  | $ | 10,239",

We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties.\nMaximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have\nnot recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.\nLitigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint\non May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong\nsales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if\nthe revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nlower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also\nbenefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our\ngross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix\nwithin GeForce GPUs.\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a\nshift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions.\n36\n\n**Table p36_1**\n\n| Graphics | $ | 15,868 |  | $ | 9,834 |  | $ | 6,034 |  | 61 | % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Compute & Networking | 11,046 |  |  | 6,841 |  |  | 4,205 |  |  | 61 | % |\n| Total | $ | 26,914 |  | $ | 16,675 |  | $ | 10,239",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms\nand when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related\ndeferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts\nwith an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions,\nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was\nrecognized as revenues for the year ended",

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income\ntax expense.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four\nto five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the\nbeginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment,\nnet in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a\nresult of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 is presented below.

The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to\n2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The\nTAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially\nconsistent from 2022 to 2023.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition\ncosts, largely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee\nseverance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, other cost of revenues benefited from a\nreduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues of $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device\ncosts, compensation expenses, depreciation, and equipment-related expenses.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023\nResearch and development expenses $ 39,500 $ 45,427\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 14 % 15 %\nR&D expenses increased $5.9 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in compensation\nexpenses of $2.9 billion, $870 million in charges related to our office space optimization efforts, and an increase in\ndepreciation expense of $722 million. The $2.9 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of a\n4% increase in average headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in our workforce, and an increase\nin SBC expense. Additionally, the increase in compensation expenses included $848 million in employee severance\ncharges associated with the reduction in our workforce.

The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms\nand when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter.

The increase was also related to the growth in Automotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023\ncompared to $550 million in fiscal year 2022.\nGraphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macroeconomic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan related to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by\ngeographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different\nlocation.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and\nstock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $2.17\nbillion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13\nbillion for inventory",

Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nlower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also\nbenefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong\nsales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if\nthe revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nlower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also\nbenefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our\ngross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix\nwithin GeForce GPUs.\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a\nshift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions.\n36\n\n**Table p36_1**\n\n| Graphics | $ | 15,868 |  | $ | 9,834 |  | $ | 6,034 |  | 61 | % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Compute & Networking | 11,046 |  |  | 6,841 |  |  | 4,205 |  |  | 61 | % |\n| Total | $ | 26,914 |  | $ | 16,675 |  | $ | 10,239",

The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and\nsupport costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in\nnature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly\nattributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and\namortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recognized a warranty-related benefit of\napproximately $70 million in cost of revenue due to favorable product recovery.\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and\nemployee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties.\nMaximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
